The most complete running example would be the acceptance test of Laconia. It is
a test that's running in the cloud and try to closely simulate real world
application. It can be found
[here](https://github.com/laconiajs/laconia/tree/master/packages/laconia-acceptance-test).

Additionally, Laconia is also distributed with a few smaller examples, which can
be found [here](https://github.com/laconiajs/examples).
