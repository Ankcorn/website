As the serverless architecture in full is being adopted more by the industry,
more complicated use cases are emerging. To support these use cases, more best
practices and patterns around serverless application development are maturing.
Keeping up to date and implementing these patterns are expensive.

- Pitfalls are happening on low level API, bugs

The serverless architecture is a paradigm shift. Whilst the deployment tools in
the serverless space are maturing, there are no application development
frameworks are designed effectively for serverless architecture. There are
plenty of great web frameworks that you can use, but you will soon discover that
the web is just one of the event trigger in AWS Lambda. There are plenty of
other event triggers in AWS Lambda, there should be a more consistent way to
tackle this problem.

- JS ecosystem is not as integrated

* (must rephrase, as it's copy pasted) Laconia provides an out-of-the-box
  application architecture which allows for effortless creation of highly
  testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications.

* Laconia.js will encourage a certain style of development, outlined in the
  principles page
