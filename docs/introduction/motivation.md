- Increased adoption of serverless architecture
- Best practices are emerging and maturing
- Common patterns are emerging and expensive to implement
- Pitfalls are happening on low level API, bugs
- There are a lot of other frameworks out there, but FaaS is not about web, Laconia.js is trying to tackle that
- Check what we have shared in LOD slide and JS slide
- There are a lot of deployment frameworks too, but not development framework in NodeJS.
- Laconia.js will encourage a certain style of development, outlined in the principles page
- Highly modular and small dependencies (zero on most packages), a lot of extra files.
- (must rephrase) Laconia provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows for effortless creation of highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications.
