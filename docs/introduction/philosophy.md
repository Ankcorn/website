When you are adopting a framework, itâ€™s important to know not only what it does
but how it is designed. These are the principles that Laconia follows:

- Adopt proven architectural patterns

  As a software industry, we are getting better at making softwares. There are
  books and papers written by experienced folks. Most of the learnings out there
  are applicable in various use cases, and the learnings are equally applicable
  in the serverless world.

  Laconia at its heart, encourages the adoption of the Ports and Adapters
  pattern, or more sometimes known as the Hexagonal Architecture. Your
  application must be blissfully ignorant of the nature of its external device,
  and the cloud technologies should be treated as just another external device.

- Make known serverless design principles and best practices the default

  The design principles and best practices for serverless architecture are
  maturing. Laconia strives to make them adopted by default.

  Let's run through the
  [official best practices from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html):

  - Separate the Lambda handler (entry point) from your core logic: Laconia's
    core and primary adapters are designed for this
  - Use AWS Lambda Environment Variables to pass operational parameters to your
    function: Laconia encourages this via
    [Convention over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration).
    By convention you should configure environment variables to retrieve
    secrets, hit other Lambdas, retrieve configuration from S3, etc.
  - Minimize your deployment package size to its runtime necessities: Laconia is
    by design modular and has 0 dependencies. Install only the packages you
    need.
  - Minimize the complexity of your dependencies: Simplicity sits at the core of
    Laconia. Laconia believes that with the paradigm of shift of small
    functions, there should not be a need for complex framework.
  - Take advantage of Execution Context reuse to improve the performance of your
    function: Laconia Context instances creation are cached by default. For
    example it will not hit SSM twice to retrieve secrets if your Lambda is
    still alive.

  There are other sources like the
  [AWS Serverless Application Lens](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Serverless-Applications-Lens.pdf),
  books, various talks, and loads of content from AWS Serverless Heroes e.g.
  [Production Ready Serverless](https://productionreadyserverless.com/). Laconia
  will evolve and continue to encourage these principles by default.

* Be non intrusive. Framework is a detail

  - From clean architecture

* Set high standards for code quality.

- API Program close to programming language, higher level abstraction

  - Check zeit
  - Cleanest API is when it's close to programming language
  - Example of CORS
  - No middleware as a framework
  - Middleware as decorator function.
  - Waiting for pipe
  - invoker stack trace
  - invoker good ux

* Feature complete, like jest
