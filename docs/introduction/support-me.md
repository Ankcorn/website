Laconia doesn't have a big company behind that sits behind it. Laconia is an
Apache-licensed open source project, and is a result of the huge time
commitment, working before and after hours. I fully rely on the support of
people and community. As I'm motivated to create something that's useful for
people, I'm finding it helpful to get any kind of feedback, which you can do by
any of the following:

- Be involved in the community! Feel free to chat or ask questions at
  [gitter](https://gitter.im/laconiajs/laconia)
- If you find something wrong, missing, or might be helpful, feel free raise an
  issue or pull request in GitHub. What's helpful for is helpful for other
  people!
- If you love the project,
  [give it a star](https://github.com/laconiajs/laconia)!
- If you're using Laconia, drop a hello on
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ceilfors) or email me at wisen[at]ceilfors.com
