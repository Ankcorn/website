There are a number of popular frameworks in the Node.js ecosystem, including
Express, Koa, and Hapi for building web applications. These frameworks are built
specifically for the web. There are also libraries being built around these
frameworks for it to be used in AWS Lambda. If what you are trying to build fit
their design, you should use them.

Laconia is designed speficially for serverless application development. In our
experience, the web is just one type of transport in your application once your
architecture is growing. You can use Laconia to build multiple types of
serverless application.
