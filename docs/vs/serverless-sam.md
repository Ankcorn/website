Tools like Serverless Framework, SAM, and Apex help you deploy your serverless
application. AWS Lambda and other serverless servicescan be tedious to setup and
maintain. You should definitely use these tools to make your life easier.

Serverless deployment tools and Laconia are not mutually exclusive and can be
used in tandem. Check out the [example projects](../introduction/examples) to
see how they can work together.
